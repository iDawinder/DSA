the hollow rectangle is looks like 

* * * * *
*       *
*       *
* * * * *

so we can visualize it like matrix we read in 10th and 12th class 
in which we have rows horizontally and coloumns vertically

the size of matrix is rows into coloumns

so according to these hollow rectangle we have matrix of size

4*5

that is 4 rows and the 5 columns
