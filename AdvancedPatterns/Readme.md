## About This Folder

This folder contains **advanced pattern problems** that I solved while starting my DSA journey.

I began with pattern problems because:
- They strengthen nested loop logic
- They improve row–column visualization
- They help build a foundation useful later in **Dynamic Programming**

## Current Status
- Most patterns are completed and fully understood
- A few patterns are still pending
- Next topic: **Arrays**

## Notes
- Some pattern images are captured using a camera, so quality may be low
