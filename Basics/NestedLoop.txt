HOW A NESTED LOOP WORKS AND HOW THIS CODE PRINTS THE PATTERN

We are going to talk about HOW A NESTED LOOP WORKS and how this code is able to print the above pattern.


FIRST ITERATION

On the first iteration, we have line = 1 and star = 1.

The first condition checked in the inner loop is:

while (star <= line)

Here, 1 <= 1, which is true, so the star is printed.

Then star++ is executed, and now star becomes 2.

Now the condition is checked again:

2 <= 1

This is false, so the loop exits, and with the help of println, it goes to the next line.

Now remember that the star value will be reset to 1.



SECOND ITERATION

Now line = 2, and the inner loop checks:

1 <= 2 → true

A star is printed.

Again, star increases to 2.

The condition is checked again:

2 <= 2 → true

Another star is printed.

Now star becomes 3.

The condition is checked again:

3 <= 2 → false

The loop exits, and the star value becomes 1 again.

With the help of println, we move to the next line.

REMAINING ITERATIONS

The remaining iterations will follow the same process as explained above.

IMPORTANT NOTE

Nested loops are important to understand because later they are going to be used in DP (Dynamic Programming).
