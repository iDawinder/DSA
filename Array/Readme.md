## Note on Arrays#

I won’t go into an introduction of arrays here, as I already have experience with JavaScript and have worked on several major and minor projects of my own. So the basic concept of arrays is already clear.

The key difference between arrays in Java and JavaScript is:

Java is a statically typed language, so arrays are strictly typed.
You cannot store different types of values in the same array.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which allows storing different types of elements in the same array.
This is possible because JavaScript arrays are actually objects and behave more like lists, rather than true low-level arrays.

Example (JavaScript)
let arr = ["apple", "car", 4.5, 6];
