Binary Search

Only applied on the sorted arrays

applying the binary search on array=[1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15]
target to find 9 at which index

Dry run

while start <= end
this loop runs while the value of start is less than equal to end

we take the mid value = (start + end) / 2
where start is 0 and the end is arr.length - 1

our array has 8 elements so

(0 + 7) / 2 is equal to 3 in programming languages so our mid value comes as 3

now we check the condition to find

the condition is
if (numbers[mid] == target)

then we stop the loop
and return the mid and then exit when the condition becomes true

in our case

we have mid = 3 so numbers[mid] is numbers[3] which is 7

so check if the number is < than target is yes this means the target number must be at the right because array is sorted in ascending order
7 < 9
yes

then what we do is
start = mid + 1

now mid was 3 now we have
start = 3 + 1
start became 4

now loop when start <= end
4 <= 7 yes

then again next iteration

mid = (start + end) / 2
start value updated already
so (4 + 7) / 2 is 5

now numbers[5] which is 11
we check if 11 == target
11 == 9 no then we move

then we check
if 11 < 9 no then we move and check
if 11 > 9 yes this means

the target must be at the left now

so we
end = mid - 1
end = 5 - 1 = 4

again loop check if 4 <= 4 yes

then we
mid = (start + end) / 2

which (4 + 4) / 2 which is 4

now numbers[4] == target yes this time we got the 9
and return mid which is 4

end
